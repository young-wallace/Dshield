> ⚠️ **Plaintext localStorage — Notes stored unencrypted.** The current implementation stores bearer-spendable notes and KYC preimages as plaintext JSON in your browser's localStorage. **Any XSS vulnerability, malicious browser extension, or brief physical access to your device can allow someone to read and spend your notes.** Only use DShield on a personal, secure device. Never use it on shared or public computers. For production use, export and securely back up your notes. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#plaintext-localstorage-for-notes-and-kyc) for full details and longer-term roadmap (passphrase-derived encryption).

> ⚠️ **Rate limiter — single-instance only.** The API rate limiter (`frontend/src/lib/rateLimit.ts`) is in-memory and per-process: each server instance has its own counters, and they reset on every redeploy. This is fine for the current single-instance testnet setup, but provides no real protection in a multi-instance deployment (e.g. behind a load balancer). If you scale horizontally, replace it with a distributed limiter backed by a shared store such as [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) or Vercel KV. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#rate-limiter--single-instance-only) for the full upgrade path.

> **Private by Default. Compliant by Choice.**

DShield is a consumer-grade shielded stablecoin wallet built on Stellar that enables private USDC payments using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs).

Users can send and receive funds without publicly exposing transaction amounts, balances, or payment history while retaining the ability to selectively disclose information when required for compliance, auditing, or regulatory reporting.

Built for **Stellar Hacks: Real-World ZK**, DShield demonstrates how privacy and compliance can coexist in modern financial systems.

## New to ZK or Stellar?

See **[GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md)** for plain-English definitions of terms like _nullifier_, _commitment_, _Merkle root_, _UltraHonk_, _Poseidon2_, _selective disclosure_, _relayer_, and more — everything you need to navigate the codebase without a cryptography background.

---

## Vision

Today's digital payments force users to choose between:

- Complete transparency (traditional blockchains)
- Complete anonymity (privacy-focused networks)

Neither option works for real-world finance.

DShield introduces a third model:

> Prove what's true. Reveal nothing else.

Using Zero-Knowledge Proofs, users can prove ownership, authorization, compliance, and transaction validity without exposing sensitive financial information.

---

## Problem

Public blockchains expose:

- Wallet balances
- Transaction history
- Payment amounts
- Financial relationships

Anyone can analyze a user's entire financial activity.

For stablecoins intended for everyday payments, payroll, remittances, and commerce, this level of transparency creates serious privacy concerns.

At the same time, regulators and institutions require mechanisms for compliance and accountability.

Current privacy solutions often sacrifice one for the other.

---

## Solution

DShield combines:

- Shielded transactions
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- Selective disclosure
- Compliance-aware architecture

to create a private payments experience that feels like traditional banking while maintaining blockchain security and verifiability.

Users can:

✅ Send private USDC payments

✅ Hide transaction amounts

✅ Hide wallet balances

✅ Prevent transaction graph analysis

✅ Prove compliance without exposing personal data

✅ Reveal information only when necessary

---

## How It Works

### 1. Deposit

Users deposit USDC into a shielded pool.

The deposit creates a cryptographic commitment that represents ownership of funds without revealing balances publicly.

---

### 2. Private Transfer

When sending funds:

- A Zero-Knowledge Proof is generated client-side
- The proof demonstrates:
  - Ownership of funds
  - Valid transaction construction
  - No double-spending
  - Balance preservation

without revealing:

- Sender
- Receiver
- Amount

---

### 3. On-Chain Verification

A Soroban smart contract verifies the proof using Stellar's native ZK primitives.

Only the proof validity is revealed.

No private transaction data becomes public.

---

### 4. Selective Disclosure

Users can generate specialized proofs for:

#### Compliance Proof

Prove:

- KYC completed
- Wallet authorized
- Jurisdiction approved

without revealing identity information.

#### Audit Proof

Prove:

- Source of funds
- Transaction legitimacy
- Ownership of assets

without exposing unrelated transactions.

#### Regulatory Reporting

Reveal only the specific information required by regulators while preserving overall financial privacy.

DShield is a **variable-amount shielded pool**. A note carries its own value, hashed into its commitment, so one pool holds every amount and there are no denominations to round to. A withdrawal spends a note by paying out part or all of it and re-shielding the remainder as a new note, which can be spent the same way — repeatedly, until the balance is gone.

Every spend has the same on-chain shape: one nullifier retired, one leaf appended. A change note is created even when the payout empties the note, so nothing in the transaction reveals whether the spender still holds shielded value.

### What is and isn't hidden

Privacy here comes from breaking the link between a deposit and a later withdrawal, not from hiding that money moved:

- **Hidden**: which deposit a withdrawal came from, how much a note holds, how much shielded value an address controls, and — via the relayer — who submitted the withdrawal.
- **Visible on-chain**: that an address deposited into the pool and how much; that some recipient was paid and how much. These are ordinary token transfers, and no privacy pool on a transparent ledger can hide them.

The link is what an observer cannot reconstruct. Two things widen the gap, and both are worth using: withdraw to an address that isn't the one you deposited from, and don't withdraw a figure that matches a deposit — partial withdrawals exist partly for that reason. Depositing an unusual amount and immediately withdrawing all of it to the same address is trivially linkable no matter what the cryptography does.

## Live on Testnet

Deployed to Stellar **testnet** (`Test SDF Network ; September 2015`). View on [Stellar Expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet):

| Contract           | ID                                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shielded pool      | `CDIKKUB6XN2LLS4QMOZAVWSENCQTK546OGP3IJZ5IOR6K6G3G6EDVLNF` |
| UltraHonk verifier | `CD4QVQIPJRLLNHEVWMYBT3ZRFTQCYKV3DQU37CKYHVMBLYU6GKFRO4M4` |
| Compliance         | `CDRHRU5SMGRBD2H44LQBMGOA33JILM7PR3YF3GK57LXBXAYLAT5ADCIB` |
| Test USDC (SAC)    | `CDYZE3XQZA2UYUTYEEVLOKSYDD44CQZ6LYJIKQEDIUYBXNVSNXEQVGEG` |

> **These are fresh deployments for variable-amount notes.** The note
> commitment now binds the amount (`H(H(H(LEAF_DOMAIN, nullifier), secret),
> amount)`) and the withdrawal circuit exposes five public inputs instead of
> three, so the verification key, the verifier, and the pool all changed. Notes
> from the earlier fixed-denomination pools are not portable to these. Run
> `just deploy testnet` to provision your own set.

A full **deposit → relayed withdraw** loop has been executed on testnet: the pool paid the recipient, the nullifier was consumed, and re-submitting the same proof failed with `NullifierUsed`.

---

## Build, Run & Verify

**Prerequisites:** Rust + `wasm32v1-none`, [`stellar` CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/cli), [Noir (`nargo`)](https://noir-lang.org/docs) + Barretenberg (`bb`), Node + `pnpm`, [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just). Run `just setup` to check.

```bash
# Run all tests (Rust contracts + frontend) — 145 contract + 134 frontend tests
just test

# Local: start a quickstart network, fund accounts, deploy everything,
# and write frontend/.env.local
just start && just deploy

# Testnet: deploy all contracts and point the app at testnet
just deploy testnet

# Copy environment variables (if not using just deploy)
cp frontend/.env.local.example frontend/.env.local

# Run the wallet UI
cd frontend && pnpm install && pnpm dev   # http://localhost:3000
```

`just deploy` provisions the verifier, the shielded pool, a test-USDC asset, a compliance contract, plus a **faucet issuer** and a **relayer** account, and writes the matching `frontend/.env.local`.

---

## One-Command Demo

```bash
just demo             # privacy loop: deposit -> partial spend -> spend the remainder
just demo-compliance  # compliant disclosure: register KYC -> ZK proof -> verify
```

`just demo` runs the whole privacy loop on-chain and prints each step. It shields 10 USDC, then spends the note **twice**: first taking 4 USDC and re-shielding 6, then spending that change note for the remaining 6. Each spend generates a real ZK proof bound to the recipient and goes out **through the relayer**, so your account never appears on-chain. It finishes by checking both nullifiers were consumed and that the pool holds three leaves — the deposit plus one change note per spend, including the final spend that emptied the balance.

`just demo-compliance` runs the compliant-disclosure loop: an admin registers a KYC hash, a real compliance proof (KYC ownership + note ownership + selective amount disclosure, bound to an auditor key) is generated, and the contract verifies it on-chain — plus a negative check proving an unregistered KYC hash is rejected. Both demos take the network as an argument (e.g. `just demo-compliance testnet`).

---

## Security Model

For a consolidated circuit-versus-contract analysis, trust-boundary diagram,
and residual assumptions, see **[docs/THREAT_MODEL.md](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md)**.

Three properties hold the system together (each enforced on-chain and covered by tests):

1. **Hash consistency** — the contract's Poseidon2 (`soroban_poseidon`) produces byte-identical output to the Noir circuit and the frontend, so the on-chain Merkle root always matches the root the proof is generated against. Locked by `test_recipient_hash_matches_frontend`, `test_single_leaf_root_matches_circuit`.
2. **Recipient binding** — the withdrawal proof commits to a recipient hash, and the contract recomputes that hash from the actual payout address (`recipient_hash_from_address`) and rejects a mismatch. Without this, anyone could front-run a pending withdrawal and redirect the funds. This is also what makes the relayer trustless: it can submit or refuse, but never steal. Locked by `test_withdraw_to_different_recipient_than_proof_rejected` (a proof bound to recipient A submitted with payout address B is rejected with `RecipientMismatch`) and `test_withdraw_recipient_mismatch_rejected`; `test_withdraw_correct_recipient_passes_binding` confirms a correctly-bound recipient is not rejected by this check.
3. **Double-spend prevention** — each withdrawal consumes a nullifier stored in persistent storage; replaying a proof fails with `NullifierUsed`. Locked by `test_replaying_consumed_nullifier_returns_nullifier_used`, which replays a proof whose nullifier has already been consumed and asserts `NullifierUsed`.
4. **Value conservation** — a note's value is committed inside its leaf, and the circuit range-constrains both the note value and the payout to 64 bits before asserting `payout <= amount` and deriving `change = amount - payout`. The range check is what makes the subtraction safe: a bare `as u64` in Noir truncates without constraining, so an unconstrained `amount` near the field modulus would wrap to a small number and mint value from nothing. The contract re-checks the range when decoding the payout from the public inputs (`amount_from_field`), so a hand-crafted field element is rejected rather than truncated. Locked by `test_amount_from_field_rejects_out_of_range` and the circuit's own `constrain_u64`.
5. **Trustless tree reconstruction** — clients rebuild the withdrawal Merkle tree from the pool contract's own commitment storage, not by scanning deposit events (which depend on RPC event retention and can go missing). `get_commitments_page(start, limit)` returns leaves in order for a bounded range (capped on-chain at `MAX_PAGE_SIZE = 100` leaves per call regardless of the requested `limit`), and the frontend (`fetchCommitmentsFromChain`) pages through it until a short page signals the end. The older `get_commitments()` (no pagination) still exists for small/local pools, but reads every leaf in one call and will hit Soroban's per-transaction CPU/footprint limits well before a pool nears `MAX_LEAVES = 2^20` — prefer the paginated view for anything beyond a demo pool.

Unbounded data (commitments, nullifiers) lives in **persistent storage** with TTL extension, so the size-capped instance entry doesn't grow with usage.

> ⚠️ Testnet demo only — unaudited. `frontend/.env.local` holds throwaway dev/faucet/relayer secrets and is gitignored; do not reuse them or carry this to mainnet without an audit. The relayer takes no fee (eats gas) and is a single point of censorship (not theft).

> ⚠️ **Rate limiter — single-instance only.** The API rate limiter (`frontend/src/lib/rateLimit.ts`) is in-memory and per-process: each server instance has its own counters, and they reset on every redeploy. This is fine for the current single-instance testnet setup, but provides no real protection in a multi-instance deployment (e.g. behind a load balancer). If you scale horizontally, replace it with a distributed limiter backed by a shared store such as [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) or Vercel KV. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#rate-limiter--single-instance-only) for the full upgrade path.

## Why Stellar

Stellar has recently introduced native support for modern ZK verification through Protocol 25 and Protocol 26.

These upgrades provide:

- BN254 elliptic curve operations
- Pairing checks
- Poseidon hashing
- Multi-scalar multiplication
- Efficient zkSNARK verification

This allows DShield to verify proofs on-chain efficiently and affordably.
